# PROJECT: LIBRARY

### Brief Introduction
In this third repository from The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum under the JavaScript course, I will build a library app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


### Learning goal
- Create a Library App using object constructor


### Library App Feature
- Book cover image upload
- Assign a random color to the book cover if the image is not uploaded
- Validate the book if it is already in the library


## Reflection/Outcome
Creating this Library App was like a puzzle at first, but after a lot of searching and reading on google, I finally developed the App little by little. I use the NETFLIX UI design as inspiration for this Library App.
